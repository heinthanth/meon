## Common Questions

Here are some FAQ about `Meon` project.

-   WHY IT'S NAMED `Meon` ?

    -   it's from **Melon** and then, I removed **L**.
    -   It's sounds like **Neon**, **Xenon** and the word itself is similar to favourite pet, cat's sound **Meow**.

-   WHY THE FU\*K I CREATED THIS ?
    -   No reason! I just want to learn something new by creating something new.
    -   I gain massive knowledge about **How CPU works**, **How machine interpret and execute various instructions and jump to and from**.
